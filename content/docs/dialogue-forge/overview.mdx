# Overview

## Problem Statement

Traditional dialogue editors use node-based visual graphs. While powerful, they disconnect you from the actual experience of the conversation. You're manipulating boxes and lines instead of feeling the rhythm and tone of the dialogue.

## Solution

Dialogue Forge flips the approach: **you experience the dialogue as you build it**.

The interface looks like a chat app. An AI character speaks to you, and you respond by selecting from choices. But here's the twist—when you need a new choice, you create it on the spot. When dialogue needs to branch based on past decisions, you set those conditions in context.

## Core Concepts

### Dialogue Nodes

Each message in the conversation is a node. Nodes can be:

- **AI Messages**: What the character says
- **Choice Points**: Where the player selects a response
- **Conditional Branches**: Different paths based on memory flags

### Memory Flags

When a player makes a choice, it can set a memory flag. These flags persist throughout the conversation and can be used to:

- Unlock new dialogue options
- Lock options that shouldn't appear
- Change what the AI character says
- Create meaningful consequences

### Playthrough State

The system tracks:

- Current position in the dialogue tree
- All memory flags set during this playthrough
- History of the conversation for display

## Design Principles

1. **Play-First Design**: Build by playing, not by drawing graphs
2. **Immediate Feedback**: See changes reflected instantly
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Easy to replay and tweak
4. **Simple Data Model**: JSON-based, human-readable dialogue format
