# Yarn Spinner Format

Dialogue Forge exports to Yarn Spinner's `.yarn` format, which can be used directly in Unreal Engine with the Yarn Spinner plugin.

## Basic Syntax

```yarn
title: Start
---
Stranger: You find yourself at a crossroads.
Stranger: What brings you here?
-> I seek treasure
    <<jump TreasurePath>>
-> I seek knowledge
    <<jump KnowledgePath>>
-> None of your business
    <<set $hostile = true>>
    <<jump HostilePath>>
===
```

## Node Structure

Each dialogue node becomes a Yarn node:

```yarn
title: NodeId
---
// Content goes here
===
```

## Variables (Memory Flags)

Set variables when choices are made:

```yarn
-> Accept the quest
    <<set $quest_accepted = true>>
    <<jump QuestStart>>
```

Check variables for conditional choices:

```yarn
<<if $has_key>>
-> Use the key to unlock the door
    <<jump UnlockedDoor>>
<<endif>>

<<if $gold >= 100>>
-> Bribe the guard (100 gold)
    <<set $gold -= 100>>
    <<jump BribedGuard>>
<<endif>>
```

## Visited Tracking

Yarn Spinner tracks visited nodes automatically:

```yarn
<<if visited("MetTheStranger")>>
Stranger: We meet again, traveler.
<<else>>
Stranger: A new face in these parts.
<<endif>>
```
