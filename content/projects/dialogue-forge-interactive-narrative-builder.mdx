## Overview

Dialogue Forge is an experimental tool for building and testing branching dialogue systems. It presents a ChatGPT-like interface where you converse with an AI character, but your responses are pre-defined choices that you craft as you play. The system remembers your choices and adapts the narrative accordingly.

## Core Concept

Unlike traditional dialogue editors where you build trees in a visual graph, Dialogue Forge lets you **experience the dialogue as you create it**. You play through the conversation, and when you reach a point that needs a response, you define what options should be available. This iterative approach makes it easy to:

- Feel the pacing and tone of conversations
- Test how choices affect narrative flow
- Refine dialogue through repeated playthroughs
- Build complex branching without losing track of context

## Key Features

- **Chat Interface**: Familiar messaging UI for natural dialogue flow
- **Choice System**: Define multiple response options at any point
- **Memory System**: Track player choices and use them to gate future options
- **Conditional Dialogue**: Show/hide options based on previous decisions
- **Live Editing**: Modify dialogue nodes while playing through
- **Export/Import**: Save dialogue trees for reuse or sharing

## Technical Approach Evaluation

The goal is a **portable, easy-to-build** dialogue system that can be integrated into other projects later (with characters, game logic, etc). Here's the tradeoff analysis:

### Option A: Custom React Implementation

**Pros:**
- Full control over data format and features
- No dependencies to manage
- Tailored exactly to the "play as you build" workflow

**Cons:**
- More upfront work
- Have to build all UI from scratch
- May reinvent wheels

### Option B: Ink (Inkle's Narrative Scripting Language)

**Pros:**
- Industry-proven (used in 80 Days, Sorcery!, Heaven's Vault)
- Simple text-based syntax—extremely fast to write
- Built-in variables, conditionals, and branching
- `inkjs` runtime is lightweight and portable
- Export to JSON for any platform
- Huge community and tooling (Inky editor)

**Cons:**
- Learning a new syntax (though it's simple)
- Less control over exact data structure

### Option C: Yarn Spinner

**Pros:**
- Text-based, easy syntax with powerful features
- **Official Unreal Engine plugin**
- Built-in variables, visited node tracking, custom commands
- Can query game state (inventory, stats, achievements) via functions
- Active development and strong community
- JSON/compiled format works for web prototyping

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex than Ink
- Requires Yarn Spinner runtime

### ✅ Recommendation: Yarn Spinner + Custom UI

**Use Yarn Spinner** for dialogue authoring. It's the clear winner for Unreal integration with game systems:

1. **Unreal-Ready**: Official plugin, seamless Blueprint/C++ integration
2. **Game Systems**: Query stats, inventory, achievements directly in dialogue conditions
3. **Easy Branching**: Simple `<<if>>` syntax with variables and visited tracking
4. **Prototype First**: Build/test in web UI, then move to Unreal unchanged
5. **Rich Conditions**: `<<if $has_item("key") and $charisma >= 15>>` unlocks options

Example dialogue with game integration:
```
<<if $quest_complete("dragon_slayer") and $reputation >= 50>>
    * [Show the Dragon Slayer badge]
        Guard: "A hero! Right this way."
        -> vip_entrance
<<endif>>
<<if $gold >= 100>>
    * [Bribe the guard] 
        <<set $gold -= 100>>
        -> sneak_entrance  
<<endif>>
```

We'll use `yarnspinner-js` for the web prototype, then the same `.yarn` files work directly in Unreal.

## Try It
